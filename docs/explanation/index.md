# Explanation

Background and context for understanding RadiObject.

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | TileDB structure and design rationale |
| [Threading Model](threading-model.md) | Concurrency and context management |
| [Performance Analysis](performance-analysis.md) | Scaling, benchmarks, and optimization |

## Recommended Reading Order

Start with [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand the TileDB data model before diving into [Threading Model](threading-model.md), which covers advanced concurrency topics.

## Apply This Knowledge

After reading the explanations, apply what you've learned:

- [Tuning Concurrency](../how-to/tuning-concurrency.md) - Practical threading configuration
- [ML Integration](../how-to/ml-training.md) - DataLoader worker setup
- [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md) - All settings in one place
